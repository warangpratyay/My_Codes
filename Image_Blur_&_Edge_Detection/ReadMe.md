This is a simple code to demonstrate Image Blurring & Edge Detection using Scipy's 'convolve2d' function.

Input image used is the famous 'lena.png'. It is included in this folder.

For blurring I have first created a Gaussian Blur filter and convolved the input image over it.

For edge detection I have used horizontal and vertical edge detection numpy arrays and convolved them over the input image.
