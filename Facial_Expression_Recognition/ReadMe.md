This folder contains solution to Facial Expression Recognition(FER)Challenge in Kaggle.

This was one of my first projects in CNN.

The dataset provided is an unbalanced dataset with very few images for 'Disgust' compared to other face types.

To overcome this problem I duplicated the 'Disgust' multiple times. ( Back then I was not aware of ImageDataGenerator )

A very simple CNN model was used to get an accuracy of 60.77% in 7 epochs.
