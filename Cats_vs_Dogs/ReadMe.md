In this folder I have created a clasifier to identify Cats and Dogs images.

Here I use 'datagen.flow' function provided in Keras and Tensorflow 2.0 'preprocessing.image' modules as the number of training images is low.

I have kept the code simple without using callbacks or decaying learning rate to get a accuracy of about 70% in 25 epochs.

You can download the dataset in Kaggle:
